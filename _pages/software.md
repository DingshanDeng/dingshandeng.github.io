## The research software that I maintain:

### DiskMINT
Disk Model for INdividual Targets. 

`DiskMINT` is a useful tool to build self-consistent thermochemical disk models. It is capable of build a detailed model for individual target, as well as construct a grid of models. The production-ready version has recently released, and a detailed documentation will also be out in late 2025.

- Repo: <https://github.com/DingshanDeng/DiskMINT>
- Paper describes this: <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...954..165D/abstract>

### ysoisochrone
A user-friendly Bayesian inference of stellar age and mass from isochrones that is capable of handling different stellar isochrones. 

- Repo: <https://github.com/yourusername/ysoisochrone>
- Docs: <https://ysoisochrone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
- Quick Install (for `Python 3.+`): `pip install ysoisochrone`
