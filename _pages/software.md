## The research software that I maintain:

### DiskMINT
Disk Model for INdividual Targets.

`DiskMINT` is a useful tool to build self-consistent thermochemical disk models. It is capable of build a detailed model for individual target, as well as construct a grid of models. The production-ready version has recently been released, and a detailed documentation will also be out in late 2025.

- Link to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/DingshanDeng/DiskMINT)
- Link to the [Paper describes this (Deng et al. 2023 ApJ)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...954..165D/abstract)


### ysoisochrone
A user-friendly Bayesian inference of stellar age and mass from isochrones that is capable of handling different stellar isochrones and plot Hertzsprung–Russell diagram.

- Quick Install (for `Python 3.+`): `pip install ysoisochrone`

## Some useful links:

In AGE-PRO collabration, we developed (led by Dr. Leon Trapman) a `Python` script that is useful to analyse ALMA datacubes. 
This is discussed and presented in [AGEPRO_obs](https://zenodo.org/records/15360478).
