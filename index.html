<p>Welcome!</p> 

<p>I'm a PhD candidate at Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, the University of Arizona. My work combines observations and modeling to understand the protoplanetary disks.</p>

<p>Tucson area is not only famous for its amazing night sky, but also an oasis where desert life thrives, including many birds settle or visit through out the year. Whenever we have time, we go out for hiking, birding and star-gazing, and often involve with taking some beautiful photos that I really love to share.</p>

      <p class="paper-card__excerpt">
        AGE-PRO (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks) is an ALMA Large Program dedicated to study the disk evolution by combining a sample of 30 disks in three different star-forming regions: young Ophicus, mid-age Lupus, and older Upper Sco. I led the data calibration and analysis on the 10 disks in the Lupus star forming region, and the key results are presented in the ApJ focus issue with AGE-PRO. III summarizing the Lupus disks. We find strong correlations of the CO isotopologue line fluxes with continuum flux densities, and a correlation between C<sup>18</sup>O J=2–1 and N<sub>2</sub>H<sup>+</sup> J=3–2 fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. We also show that the estimated gas disk masses in AGE-PRO agree with those in Ruaud et al. (2022).
